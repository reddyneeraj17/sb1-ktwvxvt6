When we think about the evolution of data architectures, Kimball's methodology has been the bedrock for decades. The star schemas and structured data flows worked wonders for On-Premises Data Warehouses (OLAPs). But today, with data lakes, lakehouses, and distributed table formats like Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg dominating the scene, you might wonder – do those old-school design principles still have a place?

The short answer? Yes. But let's dive into the nuances.

## The Early Days of OLAP: Simpler Times

Back in the day, life was… simpler. You had your ETL tools like Informatica or other Etl where you could extract data, transform it into meaningful dimensions and facts, and load it neatly into your warehouse. Tools made it easy to enforce relationships between tables – your primary keys, foreign keys, and surrogate keys were all neatly managed.

In Kimball-style warehouses, this structure was gold. It worked well for analytics and reporting because your data relationships were clearly defined. Business users could slice and dice the data with ease, and OLAP cubes worked beautifully.

## Enter Data Lakes: The Wild West

Fast forward a few years, and data lakes became the buzzword. With Hadoop and cheap object storage, everyone jumped on the lake bandwagon. But there was a problem: data lakes were messy. Sure, they could hold unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, but enforcing any kind of schema or relationships? Forget it.

Star schemas? Surrogate keys? Not happening.

Instead of structured joins, we ended up with raw data dumps that needed constant wrangling. Analytics slowed down, and maintaining referential integrity became a nightmare. It wasn't long before people realized that dumping everything into a data lake wasn't the same as a warehouse.

## The Lakehouse Revolution: Bringing Order to Chaos

The rise of technologies like Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg has changed the game. These tools bring much-needed structure to data lakes, making them lakehouses – blending the scalability of lakes with the performance and schema enforcement of warehouses.

With ACID compliance, we can now handle:
- Incremental updates
- Time travel capabilities
- Metadata management at scale

But here's the kicker: designing Kimball-style models in a lakehouse is still challenging. Why? Because these tables don't inherently enforce primary and foreign keys. Designing star schemas in a distributed, schema-less environment requires you to think beyond traditional OLAP approaches.

## Distributed Systems and Shuffling: A Hidden Cost

One major hurdle with modern lakehouses is managing distributed systems. When you're working with tools like Spark or Snowflake, dremio shuffling data across nodes is a performance killer.

Think about it: in a traditional warehouse, relationships were handled elegantly with join conditions. But in a distributed environment, every join can mean shuffling data between nodes, slowing down your queries. This is why many architects lean towards denormalized tables in lakehouses – avoiding joins at the cost of flexibility.

## METL to ELT: A Paradigm Shift

A decade ago, ETL tools like Informatica were kings. They not only extracted and transformed data but also handled the heavy lifting of surrogate key generation and loading facts/dimensions with relationships intact.

Fast forward to today, and the shift to ELT has disrupted that. Data is loaded raw into the lake, and transformations happen downstream. While this works for unstructured data, maintaining the relationships and generating surrogate keys becomes tricky in ELT workflows.

In lakehouses, tools like dbt are stepping up to fill this gap, but it's not the same as having tightly coupled ETL pipelines managing your keys and relationships.

## Kimball is Still Alive (But Evolving)

So, is Kimball dead? Not at all. The principles of dimensional modeling still hold tremendous value. But we've had to adapt them to modern architectures. Here's how:

1. **Dimensional Models with a Delivery Layer**: Even in lakehouses, designing a delivery layer with star schemas can provide tremendous value for business users.
2. **Denormalization Where It Makes Sense**: To avoid costly shuffles, sometimes denormalizing data is the best option.
3. **Modern Tools**: Using dbt and similar tools to generate surrogate keys and enforce relationships downstream.

## The Future: Balancing Performance and Design

Table formats like Iceberg and Delta Lake have solved many of the early challenges of data lakes. Performance has improved, and we can now enforce structure to a certain extent. But there's still work to be done.

Here's my take: while Kimball's methodologies remain relevant, they require a modern twist. Focus on:

- **Performance**: Use partitioning and clustering to minimize shuffling in distributed systems
- **Flexibility**: Don't over-engineer relationships if they'll slow down your queries
- **Tools**: Leverage modern tools like dbt and frameworks that support surrogate key generation and ELT workflows

In the end, Kimball's legacy lives on, but it's up to us to adapt it to the tools and challenges of today's data ecosystems.
